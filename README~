     Language Identification
==================================

I wrote a simple module to identify language of an input sentence

I grabbed some training data from http://cls.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/
I use 100k sentences for each of the 3 languages eng, fra, deu - data is in
traindata directory. I also took a non intersecting corpus of test sentences 
in each language and these can be found in directory labelled testdata. 

In order to train models, please run 'python train.py'
This script will run through the train files and create unigram, bigram
and trigram statistics for each language and write them to the directory 
labelled 'models'

In order to run over test corpus, run 'python test.py' after setting
sanity_check in the script to 'True' 
The script can also be run on command line with options 
'python test.py -n 2 -i 'est la s√©lection de joueurs de'
This will output a prediction language using the pretrained models 
from the models directory
